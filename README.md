# Beat-Painter
Augmented Reality mixing game, made in Unity for Copenhagen Musikmuseet
> Semester Project for Sound and Music Computing 7 - AAU CPH

# Abstract
Beat Painter is an application prototype created for the Music Museum in Copenhagen which demonstrates how mobile AR can increase the value of a physical experience while making music virtually Augmented Reality (AR) is a valuable resource for interactive educational experiences but is still under-utilized and in its experimental stages. Audio-based AR in particular can be a powerful and entertaining tool for creative, educational, and experiential use. This project aims to explore how one can mix audio using mobile augmented reality, teach audio production techniques, and in addition, enhance a physical location based experience such as a museum.

# Usage
This application is organised as a Unity Project. Run Unity Hub and add the folder `BeatPainter` as a new project.
For using the application, print the images located in the `imagetargets` folder and keep them in front of of the webcam one at a time while the project is running

Inside `AudioPluginPlugins` directory it is located the XCode project relative to the audio effects that are used in the application. These effects were implemented using Unity's [Native Audio Plugin SDK](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixerNativeAudioPlugin.html).
